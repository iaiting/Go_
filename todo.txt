V-make Go have an orginized layout with space for pass button & chat
V-implement 'pass' move logic
V-implement endgame logic (win/lose)
V-implement resign
V-implement go back to lobby after game finished
-fix BUG when back to lobby & then rematch - the button are still like endgame. solution: clear_widgets on scrren entry add the board & info widgets programmatically
-implement rematch
-make game info label fit info section
-implement chat
-implement game spectating
-add an option to play against ai in 'create game'
-implement ai:
    -train NN from sgf files:
           ``-read about batches in training
           -divide sgf data into batches
    V-handle invalid moves
    -in training: train data with rotations
    -in training data: make inputs: empty/me/enemy (instead of empty/black/white). should improve nn efficiency. => also remove input data for who's turn it is (with this tweak it's redundant).
    -do a big training session
    -implement MCTS:
        V-convert current MCTS to work with Go. should work be generalized to work with a policy & a game state
        -Vcheck MCTS with random policyV & nn policy
        -search for performance bottlenecks with MCTS
    -train heavy NN for expansion phase & light NN for rollouts to increase performance
